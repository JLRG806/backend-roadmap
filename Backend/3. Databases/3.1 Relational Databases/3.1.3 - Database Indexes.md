## Database Indexes

### What is a Database Index?

A **database index** is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table at the cost of additional storage and write time. Think of an index like a book's index: instead of scanning the entire book to find a topic, you can quickly locate the page number using the index.

### Why Use Indexes?

- **Speed Up Queries**: Indexes significantly reduce the time it takes to find specific rows in a large table.
- **Efficient Data Access**: They are particularly useful for queries that filter rows using `WHERE` clauses, join tables, or sort data with `ORDER BY`.

### How Indexes Work

When you create an index on a column, the database creates a separate data structure that holds the values of that column along with pointers to the corresponding rows in the table. When a query is run that uses the indexed column, the database can quickly locate the desired rows using the index instead of scanning the entire table.

### Types of Indexes

1. **Single-Column Index**:
   - **Definition**: An index on a single column.
   - **Example**: 
     ```sql
     CREATE INDEX idx_username ON Users(username);
     ```
     - This index allows for faster searches by `username`.

2. **Composite Index**:
   - **Definition**: An index on multiple columns.
   - **Example**: 
     ```sql
     CREATE INDEX idx_user_email ON Users(username, email);
     ```
     - This index is useful for queries that filter by both `username` and `email`.

3. **Unique Index**:
   - **Definition**: Ensures that all the values in the indexed column(s) are unique.
   - **Example**: 
     ```sql
     CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_unique_email ON Users(email);
     ```
     - This index prevents duplicate email addresses in the `Users` table.

4. **Full-Text Index**:
   - **Definition**: Used for full-text search capabilities, allowing you to search for keywords within text columns.
   - **Example**:
     ```sql
     CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX idx_post_content ON Posts(content);
     ```
     - This index is ideal for searching large text fields like blog posts.

5. **Clustered Index**:
   - **Definition**: Determines the physical order of data in the table. A table can have only one clustered index.
   - **Example**:
     ```sql
     CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX idx_order_id ON Orders(order_id);
     ```
     - The rows in the `Orders` table are physically sorted by `order_id`.

### Best Practices for Using Indexes

- **Index Selectively**: Only create indexes on columns that are frequently used in queries. Too many indexes can slow down `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations because the indexes also need to be updated.
  
- **Use Composite Indexes Carefully**: The order of columns in a composite index matters. The index is most useful when the leading column(s) are used in the query conditions.

- **Avoid Indexing Columns with Low Cardinality**: Columns with low cardinality (few unique values, like a boolean field) are not good candidates for indexing, as the index won't provide much performance benefit.

- **Monitor Index Performance**: Regularly analyze and optimize your indexes. Over time, query patterns may change, and indexes that were once helpful might become unnecessary.

### When Not to Use Indexes

- **For Small Tables**: If your table has very few rows, scanning the entire table might be just as fast or faster than using an index.
  
- **For Frequently Updated Columns**: Indexes can slow down `UPDATE` and `INSERT` operations because the index also needs to be updated.

### Example Scenario: Optimizing a Query

Imagine you have a `Products` table with columns `id`, `name`, `category`, `price`, and `stock_quantity`. If you frequently run queries like:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Products WHERE category = 'Electronics' AND price < 100;
```

Creating a composite index on `category` and `price` can significantly speed up this query:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_category_price ON Products(category, price);
```
