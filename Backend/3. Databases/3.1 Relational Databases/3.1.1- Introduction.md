## Relational Databases

### What is a Relational Database?

A **relational database** is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another. Data in a relational database is organized into tables, which consist of rows and columns, much like a spreadsheet. Each table represents a different entity, such as "Users" or "Orders."

### Key Concepts

1. **Tables**:
   - **Definition**: A table is a collection of related data entries and consists of columns and rows.
   - **Example**: 
     - Table Name: `Users`
     - Columns: `id`, `username`, `email`, `created_at`
     - Rows: Each row represents a single user.

   ```plaintext
   | id  | username  | email             | created_at          |
   | --- | --------- | ----------------- | ------------------- |
   | 1   | johndoe   | john@example.com  | 2024-09-23 10:00:00 |
   | 2   | janedoe   | jane@example.com  | 2024-09-23 11:00:00 |
   ```

- **Primary Key**:
    
    - **Definition**: A primary key is a unique identifier for each row in a table. It ensures that no two rows have the same primary key value.
    - **Best Practice**: Use an `id` column with an auto-incrementing integer as the primary key.
- **Foreign Key**:
    
    - **Definition**: A foreign key is a column that creates a relationship between two tables. It refers to the primary key in another table.
    - **Example**:
        - `Orders` table has a `user_id` column that is a foreign key referring to the `id` column in the `Users` table.
    - **Why It's Important**: Foreign keys enforce referential integrity, ensuring that relationships between tables remain consistent.
- **SQL (Structured Query Language)**:
    
    - **Definition**: SQL is the language used to interact with a relational database. It allows you to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) data.
    - **Example Queries**:
        - **Select all users**:
```sql
	SELECT * FROM Users;
```

- **Insert a new user**:
```sql
	INSERT INTO Users (username, email, created_at)
	VALUES ('newuser', 'newuser@example.com', NOW());
```

### Best Practices

- **Normalization**: Organize your data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. This process is known as database normalization. Start with the first three normal forms:
    
    1. **1NF**: Ensure that each table column contains atomic (indivisible) values.
    2. **2NF**: Ensure that all non-key attributes are fully dependent on the primary key.
    3. **3NF**: Ensure that no transitive dependencies exist (i.e., non-key attributes depend on other non-key attributes).
- **Indexing**: Create indexes on columns that are frequently used in search conditions (e.g., `WHERE` clauses). This speeds up query performance but use indexes sparingly as they can slow down write operations.
    
- **Use Transactions**: For operations that modify multiple tables, use transactions to ensure that all changes are made safely. If something goes wrong, a transaction can roll back the changes to maintain consistency.
    

### Example Project: Building a Simple Blog

To practice using a relational database, you can create a simple blog application with the following tables:

1. `Users`: Store information about the authors.
2. `Posts`: Store the blog posts, including a foreign key to the `Users` table.
3. `Comments`: Store comments on posts, with foreign keys to both `Posts` and `Users`.
