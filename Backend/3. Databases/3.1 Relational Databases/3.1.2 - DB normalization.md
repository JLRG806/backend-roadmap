## Database Normalization

### What is Database Normalization?

**Database normalization** is the process of organizing the columns (attributes) and tables (relations) of a relational database to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity. By eliminating duplicate data and ensuring that related data is stored in separate tables, normalization makes your database more efficient and easier to maintain.

### Why Normalize?

- **Eliminate Redundancy**: Avoid storing the same piece of data in multiple places. This saves storage space and reduces the risk of inconsistent data.
- **Improve Data Integrity**: Ensures that your data is accurate and consistent across the database.
- **Simplify Database Design**: A well-normalized database is easier to modify, query, and expand as your application grows.

### Normal Forms

Normalization is typically done in stages, each stage is called a "normal form." The most common normal forms are the First, Second, and Third Normal Forms (1NF, 2NF, and 3NF).

#### 1. First Normal Form (1NF)

**Rule**: Each table column should contain atomic (indivisible) values, and each entry in a column must be of the same data type. The table should not contain any repeating groups or arrays.

**Example**:
- **Not in 1NF**:

| id  | customer_name | phone_numbers      |
| --- | ------------- | ------------------ |
| 1   | John Doe      | 123-4567, 987-6543 |
| 2   | John Doe      | 987-6543           |

- Here, `phone_numbers` contains multiple values in a single column, which violates 1NF.
    
- **In 1NF**:

| id  | customer_name | phone_number |
| --- | ------------- | ------------ |
| 1   | John Doe      | 123-4567     |
| 2   | John Doe      | 987-6543     |

- Now, each value in `phone_number` is atomic, and the table conforms to 1NF.

#### 2. Second Normal Form (2NF)

**Rule**: The table should be in 1NF, and all non-key attributes (columns) must be fully dependent on the primary key.

**Example**:

- **Not in 2NF**:

| order_id | product_id | product_name | quantity |
| --------- | ------------ | ---------------- | --------- |
| 101        | 1                 | Widget A         | 2            |
| 101        | 2                 | Widget B         | 5            |
- Here, `product_name` depends on `product_id`, not `order_id`, which means it does not fully depend on the primary key (`order_id`, `product_id`).
- **In 2NF**:
    
    - Split the table into two:
Orders Table:

| order_id | product_id | quantity |
| --------- | ------------ | --------- |
| 101      | 1          | 2        |
| 101      | 2          | 5        |

Products Table:

| product_id | product_name |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| 1          | Widget A     |
| 2          | Widget B     |
- Now, `product_name` is moved to a separate `Products` table, and each attribute in the `Orders` table fully depends on the composite primary key (`order_id`, `product_id`).

#### 3. Third Normal Form (3NF)

**Rule**: The table should be in 2NF, and all the attributes should be directly dependent on the primary key, meaning there should be no transitive dependency (no non-key attribute depends on another non-key attribute).

**Example**:

- **Not in 3NF**:

| id  | employee_name | department  | department_head |
| --- | ------------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| 1   | Alice         | Sales       | Bob             |
| 2   | Charlie       | HR          | Eve             |
- Here, `department_head` depends on `department`, not directly on the primary key (`id`).
- **In 3NF**:
    - Split the table:

Employees Table:

| id  | employee_name | department |
| --- | ------------- | ---------- |
| 1   | Alice         | Sales      |
| 2   | Charlie       | HR         |

Departments Table:

| department | department_head |
| ---------- | --------------- |
| Sales      | Bob             |
| HR         | Eve             |
- Now, the `department_head` is stored in a separate `Departments` table, eliminating the transitive dependency.

### When to Normalize?

- Normalize your database during the design phase to avoid complex refactoring later.
- If your database grows and you notice redundant data or performance issues, consider normalizing the affected tables.

### When Not to Over-Normalize?

- In some cases, denormalization (the opposite of normalization) may be necessary for performance reasons, especially in read-heavy applications where complex queries slow down the system.
- Use denormalization carefully, balancing the need for performance with data integrity.
