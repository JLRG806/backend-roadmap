DNS (Domain Name System) is a hierarchical, decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network. It translates human-readable domain names (like [www.example.com](http://www.example.com)) into IP addresses (like 192.0.2.1) that computers use to identify each other. DNS servers distributed worldwide work together to resolve these queries, forming a global directory service. The system uses a tree-like structure with root servers at the top, followed by top-level domain servers (.com, .org, etc.), authoritative name servers for specific domains, and local DNS servers. DNS is crucial for the functioning of the Internet, enabling users to access websites and services using memorable names instead of numerical IP addresses. It also supports email routing, service discovery, and other network protocols.
