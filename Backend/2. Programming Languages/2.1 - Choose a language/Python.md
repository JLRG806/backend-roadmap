Python is a well known programming language which is both a strongly typed and a dynamically typed language. Being an interpreted language, code is executed as soon as it is written.

Its design emphasizes code readability and a clear, straightforward syntax, making it accessible for both beginners and experienced developers. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. It has a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, such as Django and Flask for web development, Pandas and NumPy for data analysis, and TensorFlow and PyTorch for machine learning. Python is widely used in web development, data science, automation, and scripting, and it benefits from a strong community and extensive documentation.
