### What is JSON?

**JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)** is a text format for structuring data. It is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. JSON uses key-value pairs to represent data and is commonly used in web applications to transmit data between the client and server.

**Example of JSON**:
```json
{
  "name": "Alice",
  "age": 25,
  "email": "alice@example.com",
  "active": true
}
```

### Key Features of JSON

1. **Key-Value Pairs**:
    
    - Data in JSON is structured as key-value pairs. Each key is a string, and the value can be a string, number, boolean, array, or object.

**Example**:
```json
{
  "name": "Alice",
  "age": 25,
  "isActive": true
}
```

2. **Arrays**:

- JSON supports arrays, which are ordered lists of values. Arrays can hold multiple data types, including strings, numbers, objects, or even other arrays.

**Example**:
```json
{
  "name": "Alice",
  "languages": ["English", "Spanish", "French"]
}
```

3. **Nested Objects**:

- JSON allows for nested objects, making it easy to represent complex data structures.

**Example**:
```json
{
  "name": "Alice",
  "address": {
    "city": "New York",
    "zip": "10001"
  }
}
```
