# Protection Against Common Attacks

## Introduction to Common Web Attacks
Web applications are vulnerable to various security threats that can compromise user data, system integrity, and overall trust. Understanding these threats and how to protect against them is crucial for developers and security professionals.

## 1. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

### What is CSRF?
CSRF is an attack that tricks a user into executing unwanted actions on a web application in which they are authenticated. It exploits the trust that a site has in the user's browser.

### How CSRF Works
When a user is logged into a website, their browser stores a session token (like a cookie). An attacker can craft a malicious link or form that, when clicked or submitted by the user, sends a request to the target site using the user's credentials.

### Example
Imagine a user is logged into their bank account. If they visit a malicious site that sends a request to transfer funds, that request can be executed without the userâ€™s consent.

### Protection Against CSRF
- **CSRF Tokens**: Generate a unique token for each session or request and validate it on the server side. This token should be included in all forms and AJAX requests.
  
```html
<input type="hidden" name="csrf_token" value="GENERATED_CSRF_TOKEN">
```

- SameSite Cookies: Set the SameSite attribute on cookies to prevent them from being sent with cross-origin requests.

```http

Set-Cookie: sessionId=abc123; SameSite=Strict;
```

- Check Referer Header: Validate the Referer header to ensure requests are coming from trusted origins.

## 2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
### What is XSS?

XSS is an attack that allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. These scripts can execute in the context of the user's browser, stealing data or performing actions on behalf of the user.

### How XSS Works

An attacker can insert a malicious script into an input field or URL, which gets executed when another user loads the affected page.

### Example

If a user submits a comment on a blog that contains a script tag, anyone who views that comment could execute the script.

```html
<script>alert('Your session has been hijacked!');</script>
```

#### Protection Against XSS

    Input Validation and Escaping: Validate and sanitize all user inputs. Escape output data to prevent the browser from interpreting it as HTML or JavaScript.

```javascript
const safeContent = escapeHTML(userInput);
```

- Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement a CSP to restrict where scripts can be loaded from and executed.

```http
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self';
```

- Use HttpOnly Cookies: Mark cookies as HttpOnly to prevent JavaScript from accessing them.

### 3. SQL Injection
#### What is SQL Injection?

SQL Injection is a code injection technique that allows attackers to manipulate SQL queries executed by the database. It can lead to unauthorized access to data, data manipulation, or even data deletion.

#### How SQL Injection Works

An attacker injects malicious SQL code into an input field that interacts with the database, altering the intended SQL command.

#### Example

If an application constructs a SQL query like this:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'user' AND password = 'pass';
```

- An attacker could input `user' OR '1'='1` as the username and bypass authentication.

Protection Against SQL Injection

- Parameterized Queries: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to ensure that user input is treated as data, not code.

```javascript
const query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?";
db.query(query, [username, password]);
```

- Input Validation: Validate and sanitize user inputs to ensure they conform to expected formats (e.g., alphanumeric).

- Use ORM (Object-Relational Mapping): Consider using an ORM that abstracts database interactions and helps mitigate SQL injection risks.

### Conclusion

Protecting against common web attacks like CSRF, XSS, and SQL Injection requires a combination of strategies, including proper input validation, the use of tokens, and secure coding practices. By implementing these protections, developers can significantly enhance the security of their web applications.
