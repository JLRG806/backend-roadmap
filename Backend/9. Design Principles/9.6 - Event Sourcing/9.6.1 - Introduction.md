# Event Sourcing in Backend Development

## What is Event Sourcing?

**Event Sourcing** is a design pattern in which the state of an application is determined by a series of events. Rather than storing the current state of an object (e.g., the final result of a bank transaction), **every change to the state is captured as an event** and stored in an event log. This series of events can then be used to **reconstruct the state** of the object at any point in time.

In other words, instead of saving the result of operations (like updating a database record), you save the individual operations (events) themselves.

## Key Concepts in Event Sourcing

### 1. Events
- **Definition**: An event represents something that has happened in the system. It is immutable and describes a specific state change.
- **Example**: 
  - `UserRegistered` 
  - `OrderPlaced`
  - `PaymentProcessed`

Each event captures the details of the change that occurred, such as who performed the action, when it happened, and what was changed.

```json
{
  "event_type": "OrderPlaced",
  "order_id": 1234,
  "customer_id": 5678,
  "items": [
    { "product_id": "A1", "quantity": 2 }
  ],
  "timestamp": "2024-10-15T10:45:00Z"
}
```

### 2. Event Store

- Definition: An event store is a storage mechanism where all events are logged. It acts as the source of truth, as the current state of the system can be derived from the event store.

- Best Practices: Events are typically stored in append-only mode, meaning they are never modified or deleted after being created. This makes the system auditable and reliable.

### 3. State Reconstruction

- Definition: The current state of the system is reconstructed by replaying all the events related to a specific entity (e.g., a user or an order) from the event store.

- Example: To reconstruct the state of an order, the system can replay events like OrderPlaced, OrderShipped, and PaymentProcessed to determine the orderâ€™s current status.

### 4. Command and Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)

- Relation to Event Sourcing: Event Sourcing is often used together with CQRS. In CQRS, the write side (commands) generates events that are stored, and the read side (queries) retrieves data from materialized views or by replaying events.

### How Event Sourcing Works
#### 1. Capturing Events

When a change occurs in the system, an event is created and stored. For example, when a customer places an order, an OrderPlaced event is generated and saved in the event store.

```json
{
  "event_type": "OrderPlaced",
  "order_id": 1234,
  "customer_id": 5678,
  "items": [
    { "product_id": "A1", "quantity": 2 }
  ],
  "timestamp": "2024-10-15T10:45:00Z"
}
```

### 2. Storing Events

Each event is stored in the event store in chronological order. The event store logs every change, creating an audit trail of everything that has happened.

### 3. Rebuilding the State

To determine the current state of an entity (like an order or a customer), the system replays all the events for that entity in the correct sequence. Each event modifies the state until it reflects the current status.

For example, to know the current status of an order, the system will replay:

1. OrderPlaced
2. PaymentProcessed
3. OrderShipped

This provides the most up-to-date view of the order.

### When to Use Event Sourcing?

Event sourcing is not for every project. Consider using it when:

- Auditability and a reliable change history are essential.
- The domain logic is complex, and capturing every change in the system is critical.
- You need reproducibility (being able to reconstruct the state of the system at any point in time).
- You are working with distributed systems and need a decoupled event-driven architecture.
