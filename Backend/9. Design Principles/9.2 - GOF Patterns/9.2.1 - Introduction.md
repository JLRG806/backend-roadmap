# GoF (Gang of Four) Design Patterns in Backend Development

## Introduction to Design Patterns

Design patterns are **reusable solutions** to common software design problems. They provide a standard approach to solving problems in software development, making your code more modular, maintainable, and scalable.

The **Gang of Four (GoF)** refers to four authors (Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, John Vlissides) who introduced 23 design patterns in their book _"Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software."_ These patterns are classified into three categories:
1. **Creational Patterns**
2. **Structural Patterns**
3. **Behavioral Patterns**

## 1. Creational Patterns

Creational patterns focus on **object creation mechanisms**, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

### 1.1 Singleton Pattern

**Purpose**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

**Example**:
```python
class Singleton:
    _instance = None

    @staticmethod
    def get_instance():
        if Singleton._instance is None:
            Singleton._instance = Singleton()
        return Singleton._instance
```

**Use Case**: Logging, configuration settings, or database connections where you only need one instance.

### 1.2 Factory Method Pattern

**Purpose**: Defines an interface for creating objects but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.

**Example**:
```python
class ProductFactory:
    def create_product(self, product_type):
        if product_type == 'A':
            return ProductA()
        elif product_type == 'B':
            return ProductB()

class ProductA:
    pass

class ProductB:
    pass
```

**Use Case**: When the exact type of object needs to be determined at runtime.


### 1.3 Abstract Factory Pattern

**Purpose**: Provides an interface to create families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

**Example**:
```python
class AbstractFactory:
    def create_button(self):
        pass

class WindowsFactory(AbstractFactory):
    def create_button(self):
        return WindowsButton()

class MacFactory(AbstractFactory):
    def create_button(self):
        return MacButton()

class WindowsButton:
    pass

class MacButton:
    pass
```

**Use Case**: When you need to create related objects (like UI elements) that depend on the platform (e.g., Windows, macOS).

## 2. Structural Patterns

Structural patterns deal with object `composition`, creating relationships between objects to form larger structures.

### 2.1 Adapter Pattern

**Purpose**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together. It wraps an existing class with a new interface.

**Example**:
```python
class OldSystem:
    def old_method(self):
        return "Old System"

class Adapter:
    def __init__(self, old_system):
        self.old_system = old_system

    def new_method(self):
        return self.old_system.old_method()
```

**Use Case**: When integrating a new system with an existing system that has incompatible interfaces.
