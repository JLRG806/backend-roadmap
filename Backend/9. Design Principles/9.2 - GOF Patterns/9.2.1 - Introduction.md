# GoF (Gang of Four) Design Patterns in Backend Development

## Introduction to Design Patterns

Design patterns are **reusable solutions** to common software design problems. They provide a standard approach to solving problems in software development, making your code more modular, maintainable, and scalable.

The **Gang of Four (GoF)** refers to four authors (Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, John Vlissides) who introduced 23 design patterns in their book _"Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software."_ These patterns are classified into three categories:
1. **Creational Patterns**
2. **Structural Patterns**
3. **Behavioral Patterns**

## 1. Creational Patterns

Creational patterns focus on **object creation mechanisms**, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

### 1.1 Singleton Pattern

**Purpose**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

**Example**:
```python
class Singleton:
    _instance = None

    @staticmethod
    def get_instance():
        if Singleton._instance is None:
            Singleton._instance = Singleton()
        return Singleton._instance
```

**Use Case**: Logging, configuration settings, or database connections where you only need one instance.

### 1.2 Factory Method Pattern

**Purpose**: Defines an interface for creating objects but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.

**Example**:
```python
class ProductFactory:
    def create_product(self, product_type):
        if product_type == 'A':
            return ProductA()
        elif product_type == 'B':
            return ProductB()

class ProductA:
    pass

class ProductB:
    pass
```

**Use Case**: When the exact type of object needs to be determined at runtime.


### 1.3 Abstract Factory Pattern

**Purpose**: Provides an interface to create families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

**Example**:
```python
class AbstractFactory:
    def create_button(self):
        pass

class WindowsFactory(AbstractFactory):
    def create_button(self):
        return WindowsButton()

class MacFactory(AbstractFactory):
    def create_button(self):
        return MacButton()

class WindowsButton:
    pass

class MacButton:
    pass
```

**Use Case**: When you need to create related objects (like UI elements) that depend on the platform (e.g., Windows, macOS).

---

## 2. Structural Patterns

Structural patterns deal with object `composition`, creating relationships between objects to form larger structures.

### 2.1 Adapter Pattern

**Purpose**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together. It wraps an existing class with a new interface.

**Example**:
```python
class OldSystem:
    def old_method(self):
        return "Old System"

class Adapter:
    def __init__(self, old_system):
        self.old_system = old_system

    def new_method(self):
        return self.old_system.old_method()
```

**Use Case**: When integrating a new system with an existing system that has incompatible interfaces.

### 2.2 Composite Pattern

**Purpose**: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

**Example**:
```python
class Component:
    def operation(self):
        pass

class Leaf(Component):
    def operation(self):
        return "Leaf operation"

class Composite(Component):
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = []

    def add(self, component):
        self.children.append(component)

    def operation(self):
        results = []
        for child in self.children:
            results.append(child.operation())
        return "+".join(results)
```
**Use Case**: Representing a tree-like structure (e.g., a file system, organization hierarchies).

### Conclusion

The Gang of Four (GoF) Design Patterns are fundamental to writing clean, maintainable, and efficient code. By understanding and applying these patterns, developers can solve common problems with proven solutions, making their software more modular, scalable, and flexible.

For beginners, it's essential to understand the problem each pattern solves and when to apply it, rather than trying to memorize the pattern itself.
